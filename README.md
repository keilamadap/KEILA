<strong>Hello there 👋 </strong><br>
My name is Keila Amada and I'm a front-end web developer 😊 <br>
I have a bachelor degree in Science and Technology that gave me many gifts along the way, including an Education exchange experience living abroad in the United States for eighteen months. I started my journey by studying HTML and CSS in order to perfect my initial programming skills, but it was only after I studied JavaScript that I could find myself in React ❤️ 
In my spare time I love to practice my coding skills and learn from all the different advices and tips my dev friends share with me, I am also a 90's gamer kid at heart who's currently (and forever) in love with old videogames and chess 🤓
