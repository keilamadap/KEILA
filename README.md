<strong>Hello there 👋 </strong><br>
My name is Keila Amada and I'm a front-end web developer in development 😊 I have a bachelor degree in Science and Technology that gave me many gifts along the way, including an Education exchange experience living abroad in the United States for eighteen months. During that time I've learned how to understand different cultures as well as different languages, which lead my way to the programming world and taught me that I can communicate with computers just as great as I can communicate with people! I started my journey by studying HTML and CSS in order to perfect my initial programming skills, but it was only after I studied JavaScript that I could find myself in React.js ❤️ 
In my spare time I love to practice my coding skills and learn from the different advices and tips my dev friends share with me, I am also a 90's gamer kid at heart who's currently (and forever) in love with old videogames and chess 🤓!
